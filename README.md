### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

This project was pretty straight forward. The only thing I had to do to make my workflow a bit easier and spare me the guessing, was opening the provided screenshot in Photoshop and measuring the dimensions of the elements (since I don't have a Premium Account to get the design files).
